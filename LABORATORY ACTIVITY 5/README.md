<b><i> This Java application demonstrates the usage of inheritance, classes, objects, arrays, and other concepts from object-oriented programming. The Person class serves as the parent class and contains common information like name, age, and gender. The Student and Teacher classes will help from these shared traits since they both inherit from the Person class. The Student class adds a student ID, whereas the Teacher class has a department and a list of courses offered. The Course class represents a subject with a course code and course name. The primary software displays the data created by students, instructors, and course objects. This software teaches students how inheritance works and how different classes can interact with each other in a simple example of a school system. </b></i>
