<b><i> This Java application demonstrates the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and the usage of collections. The abstract Device class represents a generic electronic device with basic functions like turning on, turning off, and displaying details. Different devices inherit this class, and each has distinct traits and behaviors. The program covers a wide range of devices, such as air conditioners, televisions, microwaves, and lamps. To show specialized information, each device overrides the details() function and has its own set of characteristics, such as temperature, brightness, channel, and timer. The LampShade class includes a copy constructor for creating a duplicate instance. In the main method, the DeviceHelper class manages a list of all devices. This utility class can count the number of devices that are currently active and turn them all on or off at once. Overall, the application helps students understand how polymorphism, abstract classes, method overriding, and object lists interact in a simple simulation of a smart home device. </b></i>
